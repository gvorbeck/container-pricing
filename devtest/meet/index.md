    For example, the loss of developer productivity when they are unable to work because the system is capped; the cost of replacing skilled developers that switch careers to work on  more 'modern' development platforms; the opportunity cost of longer development cycles leading to slower feature releases; the cost of fixing bugs that make it through to production; etc.

    NEVER position this offering as 'free'. There is a good chance the client will need to purchase additional IPLA entitlement. In order for the DevTest container to be most useful, it may also require additional hardware capacity. These can be discounted, but not 'free'.
