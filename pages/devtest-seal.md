      Work with your client on available budget and desired container size. Structure an offer such that a larger container is substantially better value.

      Your primary objective is to match a large container size (2x or above) with available budget.

      Identify any potential 'problem' areas that could require Limited Use Licenses or other special treatment.

      The Container Pricing team have a lot of experience in this part of the process.

      We are ready and willing to support you at: cpricing@us.ibm.com.

      Keep your Techline representative engaged to review changes and ensure inventory validity.

      By this point, the client should have a pretty good understanding of what they are prepared to commit under what circumstances.

      You should also have a pretty good understanding of what will it take to win and how soon the client is able to sign.

      Continue the negotiations until you reach a conditional agreement, but be sure to make clear the offer is not yet fully approved

      It is strongly recommended you engage the Container Pricing during this stage to ensure you stay within the bounds of what is possible: [cpricing@us.ibm.com](mailto:cpricing@us.ibm.com)
