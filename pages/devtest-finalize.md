      The signed contract, pricing approval and completed CPS spreadsheet needs to be sent to the Q2C team (formally called STS) and Techline for processing.

      ![Hi Patricia](/cpricing/salesguides/assets/images/visual_patemail.png)

      First, send the documents to Patricia Hadbavna from Q2C, copying the Container Pricing team to ensure a smooth process:
      * [phadbavn@sk.ibm.com](mailto:phadbavn@sk.ibm.com)
      * [cpricing@us.ibm.com](mailto:cpricing@us.ibm.com)

      Next, raise a Techline request via your normal process, for example the online TSRG form.

      If your client has an ELA, please also send the contract to the ECM team.

      If your client does not have an ELA, please also send the contract to the ESW team.

      Techline will create the DevTest inventory profile for the DevTest container and ensure it accurately aligns with the contract, so it is important you submitted both the final CPS spreadsheet and the signed contract to Techline as per the previous step.

      Techline will build the MLC configuration at 3x the DevTest MSU base (regardless of the container size), ensuring the client will not incur additional MLC charges unless they exceed the contractual 3x maximum.

      The IPLA entitlement will be configured to the DevTest Solution MSU value (i.e., chosen container size).

      Q2C will then be responsible for processing the configurations and ensuring that the data will flow from iERP/ESW to LMS along with the creation of the Solution ID which is typically created within 4-6 hours after configuration processing.

      Keep your Techline representative engaged to review changes and ensure inventory validity.
  - title: "Step 3: Circle back with your client"
    text: |
      Once the Solution ID is in the system, your client will be able to access it through the standard LMS ibm.com/software/lms portal.

      Confirm with your client that they can see their Solution ID and check if they have any outstanding questions.

      Your client can use that Solution ID to establish the container on their next SCRT submission, even if the contract was signed midway through the reporting period.

      The container is not effective until a valid SCRT report with the Container configuration is received by IBM.

      Once a valid SCRT report has been received, the Q2C SCRT team and Techline will monitor and track the reported Container Solution on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with the signed contract.
